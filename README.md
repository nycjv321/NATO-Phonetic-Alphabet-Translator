# NATO Phonetic Alphabet Translator
## About

Tanslates English to Nato Phonetic.

### Why Haskell?
I've been reading [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) and wanted to see if I could apply what I've read to a problem outside of the book. I come from an imperative background (Java, Ruby, VB, Oh My!) and writing purely functional code is such a different world.

## Building

    ghc nato_phone_translator.hs
